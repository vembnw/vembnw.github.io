<h1>This will be my final page for the project.</h1>

<p>I hope you learned some new information about me through this project.</p>
<br>
<p>I have enjoyed this class immensely.</p>
<p>Going from having never coded to having to code every week has been interesting.</p>
<p>I think I have developed useful skills that will stay with me.</p>
<br>
<p>Hopefully, I have completed this assignment correctly.</p>
<p>I have never used GitHub before this class, so I had to learn how to use it.</p>
<br>
<p>However,  I did not mind picking up a new skill for this class.</p>
<br>
<p>I am glad I have learned this skill!</p>
