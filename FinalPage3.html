            <p id="born">I was born in Missouri. However, my family moved a lot.</p>
            <p>My father was active duty military when I was a kid</p>
            <br>
            <p>I have lived in Missouri, Rhode Island, Georgia, and Tennessee.</p>
            <p>I consider TN to be my home, since I lived there from when I was 6 years old.</p>
            <p>I have the most memories of Memphis, so it is my home.</p>

            <br>
